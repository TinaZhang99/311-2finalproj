Position:   1
Length:     6
Label:      Student ID

Description:
Student ID is composed of the 4-digit School ID (which consists of
the 3-digit stratum and 1-digit PSU) and a 2-digit sequential
student code within school.
Stratum (STRAT_ID) and PSU are embedded in STU_ID for ease of use
in certain variance estimation programs.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard-copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated-version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Name:       STRAT_ID
Position:   11
Length:     3
Label:      Stratum

Description:
This variable is a component of the ELS:2002 school ID (first three
digits). It indicates the analysis stratum to be used for computing
Taylor Series variance estimates. The analysis strata were formed
from the sampling strata used in the first stage of sampling. STRAT_ID
is developed at the school level and replicated at the student level.
This school level STRAT_ID should be used when generating school
estimates. In order to support improved variance estimation, a
larger number of strata (with fewer PSUs per stratum -- up to 3 PSUs
per stratum) are used in ELS:2002, compared to NELS:88 or HS&B. See
section 3.5 of the ELS:2002 Base Year Data File User's Manual.

Description:
This variable is a component of the ELS:2002 school ID (fourth
digit). It indicates the analysis primary sampling unit (PSU, i.e.,
School) to be used for computing Taylor Series variance estimates.
PSU is developed at the school level and replicated at the student
level. This school level PSU should be used when generating school
estimates. In order to support improved variance estimation, a
larger number of strata (with fewer PSUs per stratum -- up to 3 PSUs
per stratum) are used in ELS:2002, compared to NELS:88 or HS&B.

Length:     4
Label:      Link to first follow-up school

Description:
F1SCH_ID is an ID corresponding to the school in which the student
is enrolled at the time of the first follow-up. F1SCH_ID values
pertain to in-school students still attending their base-year
school. F1SCH_ID values match SCH_ID values for base-year
schools. New schools were assigned values from 9995
to 9999. (See section 3.3 of the ELS:2002 Base-Year to First
Follow-up Data File User's Manual for definition of "new schools.")
F1SCH_ID is set to -8 for a student not attending a base-year or new
school in the first follow-up.

Label:      Sample member status in BY and F1 rounds

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year and first follow-up
status of sample members. This variable has valid values that
account for every pattern encountered by ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status followed by F1 status.
Definition of BY component within value label
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent with the following trailing
       characters meaning:
       A=In-school, in grade
       B=In-School out-of-grade
       D=Dropout
       F=Freshened
       E=Received HS diploma early (on or before 3/15/2004)
       G=Received GED/HS equivalent early (on or before 3/15/2004)
       H=Homeschooled
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F1UNIV1 = 101 relate to sample members with
the following participation patterns:  "BYR F1RA" In other words,
the sample members were BY respondents and F1 respondents
in-School/in grade.
Note: F1ESSTAT and F1NRSTAT are variables used below in the SAS code
that are available only on the restricted use ECB. Their logic is
applicable to sample members in the restricted use file only.

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year, first follow-up, and second
follow-up status of each sample member. This variable has values that
account for all possible status patterns of ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status, F1 status, and F2 status,
respectively.
Definition of BY component within value label:
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label:
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
Definition of F2 component within value label:
   F2R=Second Follow-up Respondent
   F2NR=Second Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F2OD= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F2OS= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F2UNIV1=101 (BYR F1R F2R) relate to sample
members who were respondents in the base year, first follow-up, and
second follow-up surveys.

Name:       G12COHRT
Position:   49
Length:     2
Label:      Spring 2004 senior cohort member

Description:
This variable indicates whether the sample member is a Senior cohort
member, i.e., a spring 2004 12th-grader. F1-identified senior
cohort members include F1 respondents at base year schools, as well as
those who transferred, if they indicated they were 12th-graders.
Spring 2004 grade was imputed where missing for F1 respondents (see
also F1GRADE/F2F1GRDE). G12COHRT has also been updated since the
first follow-up version to identify F1 nonrespondents whose second
follow-up or transcript information indicates they were in fact spring
2004 12th-graders. Values of 2 also include freshened cases who
were F1 questionnaire-ineligible.
Use G12COHRT in concert with F1, transcript, or F2 weights to get an
appropriately weighted sample that generalizes to the 2004 spring term
senior class. For example, G12COHRT=1 used with F1QWT generates
estimates for a nationally representative, cross-sectional population
of the 2004 spring term senior class. G12CHORT>0 used with F2F1WT
generates estimates for a nationally representative panel of the
spring term senior class, including F1 nonrespondents.
SAS Code:
If G12COHRT = 0 And F1NRSTAT > 0 Then Do;
   If F2F1GRDE=12 Then G12COHRT=2;

Description:
Student final weight for all base year responding students. See
section 3.4.2 of the ELS:2002 Base Year Data File User's Manual.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Description:
Student final weight for the expanded sample of questionnaire-eligible
and questionnaire-ineligible students. Questionnaire-ineligible
students were excused from completion of the questionnaire or the
test when (for reasons of their lack of proficiency in English or
severe disabilities) they could not validly be assessed or complete a
questionnaire, or could only be surveyed under conditions that would
be unduly arduous or uncomfortable for them. This weight can be used
for analyses including the base year expanded sample.

Position:   75
Length:     2
Label:      Student's race/ethnicity-composite

Description:
BYRACE was previously named RACE on the BY ECB.
The race/Hispanic ethnicity variable is obtained from the student
questionnaire, when available; sampling roster, if missing on the
questionnaire; or parent questionnaire, if missing on the sampling
roster and parent respondent is biological parent. Race/ethnicity was
logically imputed from other questionnaire items (e.g., surname,
native language) if missing from all available sources. Race adheres
to the following definitions:
American Indian or Alaska Native, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes only persons who reported American Indian or
Alaska Native as their sole race and did not report Hispanic
ethnicity)
Asian, Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes persons who reported Asian as their sole race,
but did not report Hispanic ethnicity. Additionally, Hawaiians and
Pacific Islanders are included in this category even though they were
collected separately, due to small reported numbers and to preserve
consistency with related longitudinal studies. The restricted-use
data file contains a variable which maintains a separate category for
Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders.)
Black, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes only persons who reported Black as their sole
race, but did not report Hispanic ethnicity)
Hispanic, no race specified
(This category includes Hispanic or Latino ethnicity only. Race
information was not reported for these cases; only Hispanic
indication.)
Hispanic or Latino, regardless of race
(This category includes Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and any
combination of race)
More than one race, non-Hispanic
(This category includes only persons who reported two or more races
but did not report Hispanic ethnicity)
White, not Hispanic or Latino
(This category includes only persons who reported White as their sole
race but did not report Hispanic ethnicity)
The restricted file presents race as a series of five dichotomous
variables (the respondent is/is not White; is/is not Black, etc.).
The variables are: White, Black, American Indian/AN, Asian, Native
Hawaiian/PI. For disclosure risk reasons, simplified versions of race
appear on the public files, with NH/PI combined with Asian.

Description:
BYMOTHED was previously named MOTHED on the BY ECB.
The highest level of education reached by the respondent's
mother/guardian. It is obtained from the parent questionnaire when
available, or from the student questionnaire if missing on the parent
questionnaire. If missing from both sources, the variable was
imputed. See section 3.3 of the Base Year Data File User's Manual
for a discussion of the imputation procedures.
Programming Notes:
The temporary variable RSPREL generalizes the relationship
between the parent/guardian and their 10th-grader.
RSPREL is set to 'MOTHER' if the parent questionnaire respondent
is female (if BYP01 in [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15, or missing]) and to
'FATHER' if male (if BYP01 in [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]).
SAS Code:
if BYP01 indicates a male parent/guardian then RSPREL is set to
'FATHER' ;
if BYP01 indicates a female parent/guardian then RSPREL is set to
'MOTHER' ;
For cases where BYP01 is missing, RSPREL is set to 'MOTHER' ;

Description:
Indicates the highest reported level of education reported for any
parent of (1) the sample member's parent respondent, or (2) the parent
respondent's partner. This composite is constructed from parent
questionnaire variables; thus, values of -4 (nonrespondent) and -8
(survey component legitimate skip) refer to missing data from the
Parent Questionnaire.
Note:  BYGPARED is set to a nonmissing value if education level is
nmissing for at least one of the sample member's parents' parents.
It should also be noted that the sample member's parent respondent
(and/or the parent respondent's partner) are not necessarily the
sample member's biological parents; thus, BYGPARED does not
necessarily indicate the highest level of education reached among the
sample member's biological grandparents.

Label:      Base year test score status

Description:
Student for whom scores are available across math and reading tests.
The tests were administered with a two-stage adaptive design. Initial
math and reading routing tests were administered to students as the
first part of the in-school session. Then, while the students
completed the questionnaire, the Survey Administrators scored the
routing tests and determined the second-stage math and reading tests
based on the routing test scores. All tests were scored subsequently
(including rescoring of the routing tests) to determine an overall
score in reading and an overall score in math. Scores were assigned
only if a sufficient number of questions were answered for the
student.
Then, the status indicating which tests were taken was
based on whether a score was available for math and/or reading.
0 No tests
1 Reading only

grades to each of their three best friends (i.e., whether each friend
considered good grades to be "not at all important," "somewhat
important," or "very important"); this variable indicates the number
of these three best friends who considered good grades to be "very
important". This variable is calculated only for respondents who
provided information for all three friends.

Description:
Constructed based on a set of 8 interscholastic sports, and indicates
the number of these sports the respondent participated in during
the 01-02 school year, regardless of the level of participation
(junior varsity or varsity). The 8 sports used as inputs for this
variable are: baseball, softball, basketball, football, soccer, "other
interscholastic team sport," "individual interscholastic team sport,"
and cheerleading/drill team. If a respondent reports "no
interscholastic team" for each of these 8 inputs, they are coded as
BYNSPORT=99 (Student reports no sports programs at school); BYNSPORT
is calculated for all other respondents, regardless of how many
sports are reported as being offered or not offered by the
respondent's school.
Note: It is possible that respondents who reporting participating in
an "other interscholastic team sport" or an "individual
interscholastic team sport" may have actually participated in multiple
sports in those categories (e.g., tennis and golf). Since a more
detailed breakdown of sports participated in is not available, the
"other interscholastic team sport" and "individual interscholastic
team sport" categories can each count no more than once toward the
total stored in BYNSPORT.

questionnaire; these two variables were top-coded at 21 and 26 hours,
respectively. BYHMWRK values of 97, 98, and 99 indicate that at least
one of these input values was top-coded for the respondent, and
therefore a more precise value cannot be calculated.
SAS code:
If BYS34A in (-4,-8) then BYHMWRK=BYS34A;
Else if BYS34A=21 and BYS34B=26 then BYHMWRK=99;
Else if BYS34A=21 then BYHMWRK=98;
Else if BYS34B=26 then BYHMWRK=97;
Else if BYS34A<0 or BYS34B<0 then BYHMWRK=-9;
Else BYHMWRK=BYS34A + BYS34B;
Applies to: All base year respondents.

Label:      BY hrs/day watching TV/videos/playing video games (weekdays)

Description:
Indicates the average number of hours per weekday spent watching
TV/videos or playing video/computer games during the 01-02 school
year. Hours per weekday watching TV/videos and hours per weekday
playing video/computer games were collected separately as part of the
base year questionnaire.
Note: The two input variables for this composite were top-coded at "6
or more hours". BYTVVIGM is set to "8 or more hours" for any case
where one of these input variables is top-coded at "6 or more hours"
if the other input variable is at least 2 hours. If, however, one
input indicates "6 or more hours" and the other input indicates 0 or 1
hours, BYTVVIGM is set to 99 ("top-coded input; unable to calculate").
SAS code:
If BYS48A in (-4,-8) then BYTVVIGM=BYS48A;
  else if (BYS48A<0 or BYS49A<0) then BYTVVIGM=-9;
  else BYTVVIGM = BYS48A + BYS49A;
if BYTVVIGM>8 then BYTVVIGM=8; *top-code at 8;
  else if (BYS48A=6 or BYS49A=6) and 0<=BYTVVIGM<8 then BYTVVIGM=99;
Applies to: All base year respondents.

Label:      Student^s perception of teacher-student relationships in the school

Description:
This variable is a scale of the student?s perceptions of the quality
of teachers in the base year school. Higher values represent
perceptions of greater teacher quality. Variable was created through
principal factor analysis (weighted by BYSTUWT) and standardized to a
mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Only respondents who provided a
full set of responses were assigned a scale value. The coefficient of
reliability (alpha) for the scale is 0.69.

Label:      BY school safety index: principal^s perceptions

Description:
This variable is a scale of the base-year school administrator?s
perceptions of the school?s safety level. Higher values represent
perceptions of greater school safety. Variable was created through
principal factor analysis, weighted by BYSCHWT. Only administrators
who provided a full set of responses were assigned a scale value,
which was then linked to all students within the sampled school. To
distinguish administrator-based scales from student-based scales, this
variable was not standardized. The coefficient of reliability (alpha)
for the scale is 0.88.
Note: This composite is constructed from Administrator Questionnaire
variables; thus, values of -4 (nonrespondent), -8 (survey component
legitimate skip), and -9 refer to missing data from the Administrator
Questionnaire.

Label:      BY school safety index: student^s perceptions

Description:
This variable is a scale of the student?s perceptions of base-year
school safety. Higher values represent perceptions of greater school
safety. Variable was created through principal factor analysis
(weighted by BYSTUWT) and standardized to a mean of 0 and standard
deviation of 1. Only respondents who provided a full set of responses
were assigned a scale value. The coefficient of reliability (alpha)
for the scale is 0.64.

Length:     7
Label:      BY Academic climate scale

Description:
This variable is a scale of the base-year school administrator?s
perceptions of the school?s academic climate. Higher values represent
perceptions of a more academically-oriented climate. Variable was
created through principal factor analysis, weighted by BYSCHWT. Only
administrators who provided a full set of responses were assigned a
scale value, which was then linked to all students within the sampled
school. To distinguish administrator-based scales from student-based
scales, this variable was not standardized. The coefficient of
reliability (alpha) for the scale is 0.86.
Note: This composite is constructed from Administrator Questionnaire
variables; thus, values of -4 (nonrespondent), -8 (survey component
legitimate skip), and -9 refer to missing data from the Administrator
Questionnaire.

Length:     10
Label:      First follow-up questionnaire (cross-sectional) weight

Description:
This weight applies to all first follow-up respondents, regardless
of their participation status in the base year. When used with the
appropriate sample flags (selection criteria appear in parentheses
below), it allows projections to the following populations:
     -Spring 2002 10th-graders capable of completing questionnaires
     in 2004, regardless of 2002 participation (G10COHRT=1)
          or
     -Spring 2004 12th-graders capable of completing questionnaires
     in 2004 regardless of 2002 participation (G12COHRT=1).
For additional information, see section 3.4 in the ELS:2002
Base Year to First Follow-Up Data File Use's Manual.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Description:
This weight applies to sample members who are in the first follow-up
expanded sample. The first follow-up expanded sample includes
questionnaire-capable respondents and questionnaire-incapable sample
members. Questionnaire-incapable sample members were excused from
completion of the questionnaire or the test when (for reasons of
their lack of proficiency in English or severe disabilities) they
could not validly be assessed or complete a questionnaire, or could
only be surveyed under conditions that would be unduly arduous or
uncomfortable for them. When used with the appropriate sample
flags (selection criteria appear in parentheses below), it allows
projections to the following populations:
     -Spring 2002 10th-graders, regardless of 2002 participation
     (G10COHRT=1)

respondent participated in during the 03-04 school year. The 11
school-sponsored activities used as inputs for this variable are:
intramural sports, interscholastic sports, school band/chorus, a
school play or musical, student government, academic honor society,
school yearbook or newspaper, school service clubs, school academic
clubs, school hobby clubs, and school vocational clubs. This variable
combines information from the first follow-up student, abbreviated
student, transfer, homeschool, and early graduate questionnaires
(early graduate questionnaire completers were asked about activities
participated in during their last year of high school).

Name:       F1TVVIGM
Position:   910
Length:     2
Label:      F1 hrs/day watching TV/videos/playing video games (weekdays)

Description:
Indicates the average number of hours per weekday spent watching
TV/videos or playing video/computer games during the 03-04 school
year. This variable combines information from the first
follow-up student, abbreviated student, transfer, homeschool, and
early graduate questionnaires; as such, it includes hours even for
those sample members who were not in school during the 03-04 school
year. Hours per weekday watching TV/videos and hours per weekday
playing video/computer games were collected separately as part of the
first follow-up questionnaire, and are combined to produce F1TVVIGM.
Note:  Since the two input variables for this composite are made up of
ranges of hours, those input variables are first recoded to allow for
combining into one composite variable. Recoding is done as follows:
values representing "don't watch TV/videos" and "don't play video
games" are recoded as 0 hours; "less than 1 hour a day" is recoded as
0.5 hours; "1 hour or more but less than 2 hours" is recoded as 1.5
hours; "2 hours or more but less than 3 hours" is recoded as 2.5
hours; "3 hours or more but less than 5 hours" is recoded as 4 hours;
and "5 hours or more" is recoded as 5 hours. F1TVVIGM is set to "8 or
more hours" for any case where the rounded sum of the two recoded
input variables is at least 8 hours, including such cases having top-
coded input variables. F1TVVIGM is set to 99 ("top-coded input;
unable to calculate") for any case having a top-coded input but the
rounded sum of the two re-coded input variables is less than 8; for
example, if hours per weekday watching TV/videos was "5 hours or more"
and hours per weekday playing video/computer games was "less than
1 hour a day", then F1TVVIGM would be set to 99 ("top-coded input;
unable to calculate") since the true value could potentially be 6, 7,
or 8+ hours per day.
SAS code:
If F1S34A in (-4,-8) then F1TVVIGM=F1S34A;
else If F1S34A<0 or F1S35A<0 then F1TVVIGM=-9;
Else do;

Label:      F1 frequency of computer use for all purposes (hours/day)

Description:
Indicates the average number of hours per day the respondent used a
computer for all purposes as of the first follow-up, whether for
schoolwork or for other purposes. Computer use for schoolwork and
computer use for other purposes were collected separately as part of
the first follow-up questionnaire. Dropout and Early Graduate
Questionnaire completers were not asked about computer use for
schoolwork; thus, F1COMPHR values for those respondents only reflects
their report of hours per day using a computer for purposes other than
schoolwork.
Note:  Since the two input variables for this composite are made up of
ranges of hours, those input variables are first recoded to allow for
combining into one composite variable. Recoding is done as follows:
values representing no hours of computer use are recoded as 0 hours;
"less than 1 hour a day" is recoded as 0.5 hours; "1 hour or more but
less than 2 hours" is recoded as 1 hour; "2 hours or more but less
than 3 hours" is recoded as 2 hours; "3 hours or more but less than 5
hours" is recoded as 4 hours; and "5 hours or more" is recoded as 5
hours. F1COMPHR is set to "6 or more hours" for any case where the
sum of the two recoded input variables is at least 6 hours, including
such cases having top-coded input variables. F1COMPHR is set to 99
("top-coded input; unable to calculate") for any case having a top-
coded input but the sum of the two recoded input variables is less
than 6; for example, if hours per day using computer for schoolwork
was "5 hours or more" and hours per day on computer for other purposes
was "less than 1 hour a day", then F1COMPHR would be set to 99 ("top-
coded input; unable to calculate") since the true value could
potentially "At least 5 but less than 6 hours" or "6 hours or more".

Description:
Indicates whether the sample member has dropped out at some point in
time. Cases identified by F1EVERDO as ?ever dropouts? remain as such
in F2EVERDO; these cases include student-reported dropouts (as
reported via F1 participation; note, however, that F1 student,
transfer, and homeschool questionnaire respondents were not asked
whether they had had a dropout episode), and school-reported dropouts
(as reported at any of the 3 enrollment status updates). F1EVERDO is
then updated with second follow-up and transcript information as
follows:  first follow-up nonrespondents who reported in the second
follow-up that they were not in school during the spring term of 2004
(F2A12=5) or that they were out for 4 or more weeks during that term
(F2A13=1) are classified as 'ever dropouts'. Also classified as
'ever dropouts' are second follow-up respondents who reported that
they had completed a GED since they were last interviewed (F2A02=3),
or they had not received a high school credential and were not in a
high school completion program (F2A07=3 or 4). Finally, cases where
the sample member's transcript indicates that the sample member
dropped out, received a GED, was dismissed, or incarcerated
(F1RTROUT=8, 12, 14,or 15, respectively) are coded as ?ever dropouts?
in F2EVERDO.
SAS Code:

Label:      High school attainment indicator (academic risk)

Description:
This variable categorizes high school attainment on the basis of
graduation status, grades, and assessment scores. Sample members are
coded as "successful graduates" if they meet the following three
conditions: (1) they had received a high school diploma by August
2004; (2) their 10th-grade academic GPA is at least 2.5; and (3) their
base year composite ELS assessment score is at or above one-fourth of
a standard deviation below the mean. High school diploma recipients
who did not meet all of the above criteria are coded as "marginal
graduates"; sample members who received a GED or other equivalency, or
a certificate of attendance, are coded as "completers". Finally,
sample members who have not received a high school credential of any
type are coded as "non-completers."

Name:       F3PS2BA
Position:   2933
Length:     3
Label:      Number of months between PS entry and BA completion

Description:
This variable indicates the number of months between postsecondary entry and receipt of a bachelor's degree. F3PS2BA is calculated by comparing the date the respondent first attended a postsecondary institution (F3PS1START) to the date they received a bachelor's degree. If the respondent reported receipt of multiple bachelor's degrees, then the earliest bachelor's-receipt date is used in the calculation of F3PS2BA; if the respondent had not earned a bachelor's degree as of the third follow-up (F3ATTAINMENT = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), then F3PS2BA is coded as -3. F3PS2BA is imputed when missing for third follow-up respondents (use F3PS2BAIM to identify imputed F3PS2BA values).
NOTE:  Data users should note the existence of cases where the number of months between postsecondary entry and bachelor's completion (F3PS2BA) is greater than the number of months between high school completion and bachelor's completion (F3HS2BA). This data pattern is associated with sample members who reported an initial postsecondary enrollment date which precedes their high school credential date.

Applies to: ELS:2002 Third follow-up respondents who have completed a bachelor's degree or higher (i.e., ELS:2002 Third follow-up respondents where F3ATTAINMENT >= 6).

Label:      Employment status as of the F3 interview

Description:
F3EMPSTAT characterizes the respondent's employment status as of their third follow-up interview in terms of the number and type (full-time v. part-time) of job(s) they were working. If the respondent was working multiple jobs, F3EMPSTAT also indicates the number of hours worked across all their jobs. If the respondent was not working for pay as of their third follow-up interview, F3EMPSTAT distinguishes between those looking for work (“unemployed”) and those not looking for work (“out of the labor force”). F3EMPSTAT is built from third follow-up survey variables, and is imputed when missing for third follow-up respondents. Use variable F3EMPSTATIM to identify imputed values for F3EMPSTAT.

F3ONET2CURR stores the 2-digit (general category) Occupational Information Network (O*NET) code associated with the respondent's current and/or most recent job. Occupation codes were assigned primarily by the survey instrument assisted coder, and secondarily by upcoding activities. See Chapter 5 of the ELS:2002/2012 Data File Documentation (NCES 2014-364) for further information regarding upcoding activities; see www.onetonline.org for further information regarding the O*NET codeframe.
NOTE:  As a part of the ELS:2002 postsecondary transcript data release, the sample member’s current/most recent job as of F3 was also identified as a STEM or a non-STEM occupation; see F3STEMOCCCUR for the STEM occupation flag associated with the sample member’s current/most recent job as of F3.

Applies to: All ELS:2002 Third follow-up respondents who have worked for pay since January 2006 (i.e., all ELS:2002 Third follow-up respondents where F3EVRJOB=1).

(superseded by F3QTSCWT) This weight has been superseded by F3QTSCWT and is included in the postsecondary transcript (PETS) data release as a means of preserving the original values. It is one of three ELS:2002 third follow-up high postsecondary institution weights (F3QTSCWT_O, F3BYTSCWT_O, and F3F1TSCWT_O) constructed only for those sample members for whom a high postsecondary institution transcript was collected from their base year high postsecondary institution, and since superseded. The superseding versions (F3QTSCWT, F3BYTSCWT, and F3F1TSCWT respectively) were constructed in order to incorporate the approximately 230 sample members for whom high postsecondary institution transcripts were collected from transfer postsecondary  institutions but not collected from their base year high postsecondary  institutions. For additional information on this variable, please see chapter 5 of the ELS postsecondary transcript DFD.

Label:      Transcript: Institutional selectivity of institution where first known degree attained

Description:
Indicates the selectivity of the postsecondary institution where the first known degree was attained. Selectivity was attained by admissions for the postsecondary institutions reported in 2002-2012 IPEDS and 2010 Carnegie classifications. Postsecondary institutions identified as 4-year postsecondary  institutions via IPEDS data are further classified as highly selective, moderately selective, or inclusive according to the Carnegie selectivity measure; postsecondary institutions identified as 4-year postsecondary institutions via IPEDS data with unknown Carnegie selectivity are coded in F3ISELC as "selectivity not classified, 4-year postsecondary institution."  Postsecondary institutions identified as 2-year or less-than-2-year via IPEDS data are coded as such in F3ISELC. The ELS:2002 postsecondary institutional selectivity measure is based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) variable “CCUGPROF” (Carnegie Classification 2010: Undergraduate Profile):  “highly selective” 4-year postsecondary institutions refer to those whose first-year students' test scores place them in roughly the top fifth of baccalaureate postsecondary institutions; “moderately selective” 4-year postsecondary institutions refer to those whose first-year students' test scores place them in roughly the middle two-fifths of baccalaureate postsecondary institutions; “inclusive” 4-year postsecondary institutions either did not report test score data, or their scores indicate that they extend educational opportunity to a wide range of students with respect to academic preparation and achievement.

Variable logic: F3TZDEG1SLC – Institutional selectivity of institution where first degree attained

Description:
Indicates the known grade-point average (GPA) for all science and engineering-related courses taken by the student for their undergraduate education. GPA is defined as (earned credit * grade / attempted credit).

Variable logic: Where F3TCCOURSEDUP = 0, F3TCCRSLEVEL = 1 and F3TMTERMLEVL = 1
Only include courses where the start and end dates are before July 2013.
Note: do not include courses in GPA calculations when F3TCNORMGRDE ^ = 0.0 through 4.0, or when F3TCNORMATT = -9
For courses where F3TCSTEM2FLG = 2
do (F3TCNORMGRDE * F3TCNORMATT). Then sum the results and divide by the sum of F3TCNORMATT for these courses.
Courses with term end dates later than June, 2013 should be excluded from this calculation. 
if F3TZTRANRESP in (0,3), then F3TZSCENRGPA = -8;
else if F3TZTRANRESP = 2, then F3TZSCENRGPA = -4;
if no courses where F3TCCOURSEDUP = 0 or F3TCNORMATT ^= -9 or F3TCNORMGRDE ^= -9,
then F3TZSCENRGPA = -9;
If no courses are at F3TCCRSLEVEL = 1, or no courses where F3TCSTEM2FLG = 2, or when sum of F3TCNORMATT = 0, F3TZSCENRGPA = -3.

SAS code: For restricted-use licensees, the SAS code used to construct this composite variable is available via F3TZ_Student_Level_Variables.sas on the restricted-use CD/DVD.

Description:
Indicates the known grade-point average (GPA) for all STEM courses taken by the student for their undergraduate education as of June 2013. The course codes identified as STEM for this variable were adapted from the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (National SMART Grant) Program, 34 C.F.R. 691.17(d). The 2010 College Course Map (CCM) was used to code these data. See http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pets/ccm.asp for more information on the CCM.

Variable logic: Where F3TCCOURSEDUP = 0, F3TCCRSLEVEL = 1 and F3TMTERMLEVL = 1
Only include courses where the start and end dates are before July 2013.
Note: do not include courses in GPA calculations when F3TCNORMGRDE ^ = 0.0 through 4.0, or when F3TCNORMATT = -9
For courses where F3TCSTEM1FLG = 1
do (F3TCNORMGRDE * F3TCNORMATT). Then sum the results and divide by the sum of F3TCNORMATT for these courses.
Courses with term end dates later than June, 2013 should be excluded from this calculation.
